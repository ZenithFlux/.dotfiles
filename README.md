Configuration notes:

1. Source *my.bashrc* in *.bashrc*.
2. Put *conda.bashrc* in home folder because *my.bashrc* loads it from there.
3. Put *tmux* folder in ~/.config and clone **tpm** into ~/.config/tmux/plugins/tpm.
4. Put *clear_trash* in /etc/cron.daily directory to automatically delete files older than 30 days from trash.
